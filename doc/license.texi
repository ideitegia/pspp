@pspp{} is not in the public domain. It is copyrighted and there are
restrictions on its distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing
any version of this program that they might get from you.

Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of @pspp{}, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change these programs or use pieces of
them in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of @pspp{}, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for @pspp{}.  If these programs are
modified by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to
know that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any
problems introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise conditions of the license for @pspp{} are found in the
GNU General Public License.  You should have received a copy of
the GNU General Public License along  with this program; if not, write
to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth
Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA. This manual specifically
is covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (@pxref{GNU Free
Documentation License}).
