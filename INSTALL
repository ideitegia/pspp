Installation Instructions for GNU pspp
**************************************

These instructions are based on the generic GNU installation
instructions, but they have been tailored for PSPP.

Overview
========

PSPP uses the standard GNU configuration system.  Therefore, if all is well,
the following simple procedure should work, even on non-GNU systems:

 tar -xzf pspp-*.tar.gz
 cd pspp-*
 ./configure
 make 
 sudo make install

Obviously, you should replace 'pspp-*' in the above, with the name of
the tarball you are installing.  

In 99% of cases, that is all you have to do - FINISHED! 


If any part of the above process fails, then it is
likely that one or more of the necessary prerequisites is missing
from your system.  The following paragraphs contain highly detailed
information which will help you fix this.


Before You Install
==================

Before you install PSPP, you will need to install certain prerequisite
packages.  You may also want to install other packages that enable
additional functionality in PSPP.

If you do not know whether you have these installed already, you may
proceed to "Basic Installation", below.  The PSPP configuration
process will notify you about required and optional packages that are
not present on your system.

The following packages are required to install PSPP:

    * A C compiler and tool chain.  On Unix-like systems, we
      recommend GCC, but any modern compilation environment should
      work.  On Microsoft Windows, Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) and
      MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/) are known to work.

    * The GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/),
      version 1.8 or later, including libgslcblas included with GSL.

    * Perl (http://www.perl.org/), version 5.005_03 or later.  Perl is
      required during build but not after installation.

    * iconv, which should be installed as part of a Unix-like system.
      If you don't have a version already, you can install GNU
      libiconv (http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/).

    * libintl, from GNU gettext (http://ww.gnu.org/software/gettext).
      GNU libc includes an integrated libintl, so there is no need to
      separately install libintl on a GNU/Linux system.

    * zlib (http://www.zlib.net/).

The following packages are required to enable PSPP's graphing
features.  If you cannot arrange to install them, you must run
`configure' with --without-cairo (in which case you will get no graphing
capability).

    * Cairo (http://cairographics.org/), version 1.5 or later.

    * Pango (http://www.pango.org/), version 1.22 or later.

The following packages are required to enable PSPPIRE, the graphical
user interface for PSPP.  If you cannot install them or do not wish to
use the GUI, you must run `configure' with --without-gui.

    * pkg-config (http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/).  Versions
      0.18 and 0.19 have a bug that will prevent library detection,
      but other versions should be fine.

    * GTK+ (http://www.gtk.org/), version 2.24.0 or later.  However
      it must be Gtk+ 2.something  - The Gtk+-3.x series will NOT work!

    * GtkSourceView (http://projects.gnome.org/gtksourceview/) 
      version 2.2 or later.

The following packages are optional:

Installing the following packages will allow your PSPP program to read
Gnumeric files.

    * libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/).  

Installing the following packages will allow your PSPP program to write
OpenDocument text (ODT) files:

    * libxml2 (http://xmlsoft.org/).  

Other optional packages:

    * libncurses (http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/).  Without it,
      PSPP will assume it is running in an 80x25 terminal.

    * libreadline and libhistory
      (http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html).  Without
      them, interactive command editing and history features in the
      text-based user interface will be disabled.

    * Texinfo (http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/), version 4.7 or
      later.  Installing Texinfo will allow you to build PSPP
      documentation in PostScript or PDF format.

    * libpq, from Postgresql (http://postgresql.org).  This enables PSPP 
      to read Postgresql databases.  The tests for the Postgresql
      interface, but not the Postgresql interface itself, requires the
      Postgresql server to be installed.

    * The Text::Diff module for Perl (http://cpan.org).  This enables
      PSPP to test the Perl module more thoroughly.  It is not needed
      to build or use the Perl module.

Basic Installation
==================

These are installation instructions specific to PSPP (including PSPPIRE, 
the graphic user interface).  These instructions contain the
information most commonly needed by people wishing to build the
program from source.  More detailed information can be found in the
generic autoconf manual which is available at
http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/html_node/Running-configure-Scripts.html

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please
report the problem to bug-gnu-pspp@gnu.org.  We will try to figure out
how `configure' could work better in your situation for the next
release.

   The simplest way to compile PSPP is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     You may invoke `configure' with --help to see what options are
     available.  The most common of these are listed under "Optional
     Features", below.

     It is best to build and install PSPP in directories whose names do
     not contain unusual characters such as spaces or single-quotes, due
     to limitations of the tools involved in the build process.

     If you installed some of the libraries that PSPP uses in a
     non-standard location (on many systems, anywhere other than
     /usr), you may need to provide some special flags to `configure'
     to tell it where to find them.  For example, on GNU/Linux, if you
     installed some libraries in /usr/local, then you need to invoke
     it with at least the following options:

	./configure LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib' CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/local/include'

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

     If `configure' completes successfully, it prints the message
     "PSPP configured successfully." at the end of its run.
     Otherwise, it may stop with a list of packages that you must
     install before PSPP.  If it does, you need to install those
     packages, then re-run this step.  Some prerequisites may be
     omitted by passing a --without-<feature> flag to `configure' (see
     "Optional Features", below).  If you use one of these flags, then
     the feature that it disables will not be available in your PSPP
     installation.

     `configure' may also print a list of packages that you should
     consider installing.  If you install them, then re-run
     `configure', additional features will be available in your PSPP
     installation.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run the self-tests that come
     with the package.  If any of the self-tests fail, please mail
     bug-gnu-pspp@gnu.org with the details, to give the PSPP
     developers an opportunity to fix the problem in the next release.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files
     and documentation.  Ordinarily you will need root permissions to
     do this.  The "su" and "sudo" commands are common ways to obtain
     root permissions.  If you cannot get root permissions, see
     "Installation Names", below.

     Please note:  The `make install' target does NOT install the perl
     module (see below).  To install the perl module, you must change to
     the `perl-module' directory and manually run `make install' there.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems may require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

To cross-compile PSPP, you will likely need to set the
PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR environment variable to point to an
appropriate pkg-config for the cross-compilation environment.

See "Defining Variables", below, for more details.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs PSPP's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', data files under `/usr/local/share', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You may wish to install PSPP on a machine where you do not have
root permissions.  To do so, specify a prefix relative within your
home directory, e.g. `--prefix=$HOME' or `--prefix=$HOME/inst'.  All
PSPP files will be installed under the prefix directory, which `make
install' will create if necessary.  You may run PSPP directly from the
`bin' directory under the prefix directory as, e.g., `~/inst/bin/pspp'
under most shells, or for added convenience you can add the
installation directory to your PATH by editing a shell startup file
such as `.bashrc'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   You can cause programs to be installed with an extra prefix or
suffix on their names by giving `configure' the  option
`--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'. 

Optional Features
=================

`--without-cairo'
    Don't compile in support for charts (using Cairo and Pango).  This
    is useful if your system lacks these libraries.

`--without-gui'
    Don't build the PSPPIRE gui.  Use this option if you only want to
    build the command line version of PSPP.

    Cairo and Pango required to build the GUI, so --without-cairo
    implies --without-gui.

`--with-gui-tools'
    Build the gui developer tools.  There is no reason to use this
    option unless you're involved with the development of PSPP

`--without-lib{xx}'
    Optional libraries should normally be detected and the relevant
    functionality will be built they exist.  However, on some poorly
    configured systems a library may exist, but be totally broken.
    In these cases you can use --without-lib{xx} to force configure
    to disregard it.

`--without-perl-module'
   Disable building the Perl module, in case it does not build properly
   or you do not need it.

`--enable-relocatable'
   This option is useful for building a package which can be installed
   into an arbitrary directory and freely copied to any other directory.
   If you use this option, you will probably want to install the pspp
   with a command similar to "make install DESTDIR=<destination>".

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).  Here is another example:

     /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

Here the `CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash' operand causes subsequent
configuration-related scripts to be executed by `/bin/bash'.

Generic `configure' Options
===========================

`configure' also recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.
