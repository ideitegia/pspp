   Repeated reallocations are guaranteed to make progress, either by
   allocating an initial block with a nonzero size, or by allocating a
   larger block.

   In the following implementation, nonzero sizes are doubled so that
   repeated reallocations have O(N log N) overall cost rather than
   O(N**2) cost, but the specification for this function does not
   guarantee that sizes are doubled.

   Here is an example of use:

     int *p = NULL;
     struct pool *pool;
     size_t used = 0;
     size_t allocated = 0;

     void
     append_int (int value)

	 if (used == allocated)
	   p = pool_2nrealloc (pool, p, &allocated, sizeof *p);
	 p[used++] = value;
       }

   This causes x2nrealloc to allocate a block of some nonzero size the
   first time it is called.

   To have finer-grained control over the initial size, set *PN to a
   nonzero value before calling this function with P == NULL.  For
   example:

     int *p = NULL;
     struct pool *pool;
     size_t used = 0;
     size_t allocated = 0;
     size_t allocated1 = 1000;

     append_int (int value)

	 if (used == allocated)
	   {
	     p = pool_2nrealloc (pool, p, &allocated1, sizeof *p);
	     allocated = allocated1;
